===== SCENE I =====

Florence (//the DUKE's palace//).

''Enter the DUKE of Florence attended; the two Frenchmen, with a troop of soldiers.''

==== DUKE ====

So that from point to point now have you heard
The fundamental reasons of this war,
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
And more thirsts after.

=== First Lord ===

Holy seems the quarrel
Upon your grace's part; black and fearful
On the opposer.

==== DUKE ====

Therefore we marvel much our cousin **France**
Would in so just a business shut his bosom
Against our borrowing prayers.

=== Second Lord ===

__Good my lord__,
The reasons of our state I **cannot yield**,
But like a common and an outward man,
That the great figure of a council frames
By self-unable motion: therefore dare not
Say what I think of it, since I have found
Myself in my uncertain grounds to fail
As often as I guessed.

==== DUKE ====

Be it his pleasure.

=== First Lord ===

But I am sure <del>the younger of our nature</del>,
That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
Come here for physic.

==== DUKE ====

Welcome shall they be;
And all the honours that can fly from us
Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
When better fall, for your avails they fell:
Tomorrow to the field.
